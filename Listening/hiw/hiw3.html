<p class="sentence">Many species of birds cover long milesâ€™ during their seasonal migration to warmer climates. But how successful are they and do birds that get lost on their route ever survive to find their way back? Much research has been done into how birds navigate and the results show that age is a significant reason. Young birds usually just carry on, if they lose their migratory path, and thus fail to achieve their destination, whereas older, more experienced birds will generally be able to find their first route and continue successfully on their journey.</p>
