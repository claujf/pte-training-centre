<p class="sentence">It seems we now know more about outer space than we do about the Earth's core. This is because temperatures are so great at the centre of the Earth that human beings have not been able to take a close look at it. However; new techniques of analysis may soon change all that. The seismic waves formed by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions penetrate the Earth's layers at different speeds. It is now hoped that by studying these waves. scientists will be able to make new findings and solve some of the mysteries of the inside structure of the Earth.</p>
